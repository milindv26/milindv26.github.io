I am a doctoral student at Bocconi University in Milan, specializing in Economics and Finance. My research interests cover a range of topics, including Development Economics, Gender Economics, and Behavioural Economics. I am also actively involved in Data Science and Machine Learning, exploring their applications in economic research and seeking innovative solutions to complex economic problems.
