<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
I am currently pursuing my doctoral studies in Economics and Finance at Bocconi University, Milan. My academic focus encompasses a broad spectrum, including Development Economics and Gender Economics, with a particular interest in the complexities of Behavioural Economics. Additionally, I am deeply engaged in Data Science and Machine Learning, aiming to harness their potential to address economic questions and contribute to the field.
